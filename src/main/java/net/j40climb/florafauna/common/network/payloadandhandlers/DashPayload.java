// How to send packet without data from https://discord.com/channels/313125603924639766/1301510569269919784/1320686104705372191
//      > don't know if you had a response to this, but the right way to handle packets with no payload is with StreamCodec.unit()
//      >  e.g. https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/1.21/src/main/java/me/desht/pneumaticcraft/common/network/PacketLeftClickEmpty.java
//      > (1.21.1 code but that hasn't changed in 1.21.4)
//      >  you don't have to use an enum there, but it's convenient for a singleton class like this, and it's important that the instance you give to StreamCodec.unit() is the same instance that you actually send over the network
